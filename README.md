# PHP-Databank
Football databank for Russian premjer league teams created in PHP for a school project. (ELTE-IK)

The task was to create a page for a football league (doesn't matter which) by following a description.
The main page must contain links to the teams pages, in my case you can navigate to the page by clicking on the logo of the team. The main page must also contain 
a table that shows the 5 previous matches in the league. Obviously this was a starter project so we worked with made up data.

On the teams pages, we had to write tables that show all the matches of each team. The won matches are highlighted with green, the lost ones with red and the draws with yellow.
The user can log in to the databank and can add comments to the teams pages. The admin user can also delete or edit comments and matches.
